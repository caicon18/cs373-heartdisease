 Dependencies
################

    All used python modules and their versions are listed in the
    requirements.txt file.
    
    It's recommended that a python virtual environment
    is used to avoid collisions with other versions. To
    setup a python environment, run:

        $ python3 -m venv venv

    The environment can then be opened with the command:

        On Bash:
        $ source venv/bin/activate

        On Windows Command Prompt:
        $ ./venv/Scripts/activate

    More can be read about python virtual environments here:
        https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html
     
    Once your environment is ready, the necessary modules can be
    installed with the following command:
    
        $ pip install -r requirements.txt

    * Note if you run into an issue with the installation of
      seaborn, run the following command then try again:

        $ pip install wheel

################
 Running code 
################

    All written code can be compiled and run with the following command
    from the root directory:

        $ python3 sources/main.py  

    Upon running the command above, the errors of each classifier as well as
    their found hyperparameter are output to the terminal.

    Additionally, a few graphical displays may pop-up of the results.
    Comments are left within the code, describing what can be commented /
    uncommented for the desired graphical output.
